### App's feature: 
Users can input current weight and track the weight changes with specific time. There is no backend, no database yet, therefore the data is not saved anywhere, after reload the page data will disappear.
This is my first VueJs project, where I got to learn more about an other Javascript framework. Thanks to the tutorial of Firdaws Lamidi which can be found here: https://medium.com/@lamidifirdaws/how-to-build-a-weight-tracker-app-with-vue-js-and-chart-js-64836d20f87c
