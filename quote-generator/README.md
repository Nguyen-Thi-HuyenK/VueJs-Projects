- The app fetches random quotes from the “http://api.quotable.io/random” API.
- Users can see 1 quote and author at the same time.
- Users can copy the code to the clipboard and also can click "Next quote" to get the new quote.
#### This is how the app looks like:

I make this app by following the tutorial https:/www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-random-quote-generator-using-vuejs/?ref=oin_asr8, with some changes in the styling.
